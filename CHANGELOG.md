# Changelog

## v0.5.2 — Robust Shell & Cleanup Refinements
**Reliability-focused polish for shell sessions, restore preparation, and cleanup**
- Improved shell-session command handling for longer and multi-line commands.
- Made shell command cancellation and timeout handling more predictable for disconnected clients.
- Improved process cleanup before restore to reduce CRIU restore conflicts.
- Added runtime filesystem and device setup improvements for Dockerfile-built environments.
- Added `preserve_session_on_cleanup` for users who want cleanup to unmount and stop processes while keeping session files for debugging.

## v0.5.0 — Isolated Shell Sessions & Dockerfile-Based Environment Build
**Persistent shell isolation and environment construction workflow**
- Designed and implemented an RPC-based Shell Session Manager to maintain persistent, isolated shell states across checkpoints and restores.
- Extended the `exec` command to execute within the context of a managed shell session.
- Introduced a new `build` command to construct environments from a Dockerfile.
- Updated the CLI to support shell-session lifecycle management and Dockerfile-based build workflows.
- Refactored project structure.

## v0.4.0 — New Filesystem Architecture
**Major redesign of filesystem checkpointing and restore pipeline**
- Introduced a fully new filesystem architecture with parent-tracking logic.
- Re-implemented `init`, `create`, and `restore` to match the new model.
- Verified all functionalities through manual tests.
- Added various minor fixes and debugging improvements.

## v0.3.0 — Sandbox Mode & Customizable Path Config
**Filesystem isolation + configuration overhaul**
- Added Sandbox Mode using Linux namespaces and `pivot_root`.
- Optimized checkpoint/restore by excluding the working directory.
- Added customizable path configuration with a 5-level precedence order.

## v0.2.0 — Performance & Usability Improvements
**Incremental improvements before the major FS redesign**
- Added quiet CSV output mode.
